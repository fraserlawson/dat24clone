# Session 3 - Managing Data

In this session we will:

### Part 1 - Version Control with Git

- learn about Git, GitHub, and make your own repository
- understand and practise the basic Git commands you need to version your work over the remainder of the course

### Part 2 - Databases

- learn about relational databases
- learn about non-relational databases and when they're more appropriate
- practise getting data out of relational databases using SQL

## Accessing the Materials

As we discovered in class, working on my version of the course materials can cause conflicts!

By now, you should have **two** folders to work with during your course: your copy of my materials (which you `pull` from at the start of each class) and your own space for preserving and submitting work (which you update as you do exercises and assignments, and typically only `push` to).

Just as a reminder, here's the process to follow for each lesson:

- in a terminal, navigate to your copy of my course materials, `dat24`
- do a `git pull`
- every time you do an exercise, start by **copying the notebook to your own repository**
- remember to `add`, `commit`, and `push` your own work so it's available in GitHub Enterprise!
