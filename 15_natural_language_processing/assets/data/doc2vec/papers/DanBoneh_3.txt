Bivariate Polynomials Modulo Composites
and their Applications
Abstract. We investigate the hardness of finding solutions to bivariate
polynomial congruences modulo RSA composites. We establish necessary
conditions for a bivariate polynomial to be one-way, second preimage re-
sistant, and collision resistant based on arithmetic properties of the poly-
nomial. From these conditions we deduce a new computational assump-
tion that implies an efficient algebraic collision-resistant hash function.
We explore the assumption and relate it to known computational prob-
lems. The assumption leads to (i) a new statistically hiding commitment
scheme that composes well with Pedersen commitments, (ii) a conceptu-
ally simple cryptographic accumulator, and (iii) an efficient chameleon
hash function.
