Indexing for Interactive Exploration of Big Data Series
Abstract
Numerous applications continuously produce big amounts of data
series, and in several time critical scenarios analysts need to be
able to query these data as soon as they become available, which
is not currently possible with the state-of-the-art indexing methods
and for very large data series collections. In this paper, we present
the first adaptive indexing mechanism, specifically tailored to solve
the problem of indexing and querying very large data series col-
lections. The main idea is that instead of building the complete
index over the complete data set up-front and querying only later,
we interactively and adaptively build parts of the index, only for
the parts of the data on which the users pose queries. The net ef-
fect is that instead of waiting for extended periods of time for the
index creation, users can immediately start exploring the data se-
ries. We present a detailed design and evaluation of adaptive data
series indexing over both synthetic data and real-world workloads.
The results show that our approach can gracefully handle large data
series collections, while drastically reducing the data to query de-
lay: by the time state-of-the-art indexing techniques finish index-
ing 1 billion data series (and before answering even a single query),
adaptive data series indexing has already answered 3 âˆ— 10 5 queries.
