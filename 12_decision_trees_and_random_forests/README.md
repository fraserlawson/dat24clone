*If you're looking for additional references, we recommend the following books:*
- __CHAPTER 8__ - [An Introduction to Statistical Learning](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/) - This book provides a fantastic introduction to machine learning models and the statistics behind them. The visuals and explanations are really easy to understand. PDF available to download on the website.
- __CHAPTER 9__ - [Elements of Statistical Learning](http://statweb.stanford.edu/~tibs/ElemStatLearn/) - This book is by most of the same authors as the previous book, but goes into more detail. PDF available to download on the website.
