    "It is very important to realize that JSON is just plain text that you can edit in a text editor. It is called JSON because a JSON string is valid JavaScript code. Because of this, JSON has become very popular with JavaScript programmers for talking with APIs.\n",

    "* A collection of name/value pairs. In various languages, this is realized as an object, record, structure, dictionary, hash table, keyed list, or associative array.\n",
    "* An ordered list of values. In most languages, this is realized as an array, vector, list, or sequence.\n",
